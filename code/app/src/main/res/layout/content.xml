<!-- Note: some of this file was modified with the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT
for the sake of helping to make the cities in the list visually checkable by asking
how to modify my code (without changing anything drastically) so that the boxes could
be visibly checked off, with a followup message to figure out how to align the
checked circles in the center/left aligned within each city box (January 15th, 2026) -->
